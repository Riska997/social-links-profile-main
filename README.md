## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I continued implementing the flexbox to structure the layout in a column as in the previous projects I have done.

### Continued development

I plan to focus more on responsive design and CSS Grid in future projects. This is because in the last project (https://github.com/Riska997/blog-preview-card-main.git), I planned to use grid but was unable to. I need to study more on grids. Improving the use of CSS custom properties is also a goal.

### Useful resources

- [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/)- This is one of the best websites to laern coding.
